# Development overview

Mibew is a web application which uses Apache, PHP, MySQL and JavaScript. If you
want to patch the Core you also needs node.js and npm to build the sources.

All mibew sources are placed on GitHub: https://github.com/Mibew/mibew. All
official plugins are stored on GitHub too. Take a look at
[Mibew organization](https://github.com/Mibew) on GitHub to get a list of all
